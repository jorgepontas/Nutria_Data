# Analysis of Nutria Populations and Wild Sightings/Shootings in Germany 📊🦫🇩🇪
This repository contains an analysis of the nutria populations and the trends in wild sightings and shootings in Germany. The analysis is based on publicly available data sources and provides insights into the population trends of nutrias as well as changes in sightings and shootings over time.

For a more detailed understanding of the methodology and findings of this analysis, please refer to the research paper "Population Dynamics and Human-Wildlife Interactions: A Case Study of Nutria in Germany." The paper examines the factors influencing nutria populations, analyzes the spatiotemporal patterns of wild sightings and shootings, and discusses the implications for wildlife management strategies.

## Analysis Results 📈🔍

The analysis includes the following results:

1. Trend analysis of nutria populations in Germany.
2. Visualization of the geographic distribution of nutria populations.
3. Temporal trend of wild sightings of nutrias in different regions.
4. Temporal trend of nutria shootings by hunters.
5. Comparison of nutria populations with sightings and shootings to identify changes in population activity.

## Data Cleaning 🧹💻

The cleaning script (`cleaning_script.R`) demonstrates the code used for cleaning the raw data. The script removes missing values, corrects formatting issues, and performs other cleaning operations to prepare the data for analysis.

```R
# Load the "dplyr" package for data transformation
library(dplyr)

# Load the raw dataset
raw_data <- read.csv("raw_data.csv")

# Remove missing values
clean_data <- na.omit(raw_data)

# Perform additional cleaning operations
# ...

# Save the cleaned data
write.csv(clean_data, "clean_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
